Vanilla Achievements Expanded is a unique, never before seen in RimWorld modding achievement mod, part of the Vanilla Expanded mod series and a framework for other modders. 

Vanilla Achievements Expanded adds an extensive achievement system, with various different stats being tracked. Players receive a pop up rewarding them for going above and beyond and pushing their boundaries. Players receive achievement points which can not only be shown off, but also can be used to fire several types of pre-existing in-game events.
